# MattsBlog

This is a simple blog application built on the MEAN stack.  It allows for creating, updating, and deleting blog posts, displaying any posts in the database as posts are created, modified, or removed.

Follow these instuctions to run.  The app runs on port 3000.

1. Install node.js and mongoDB if not already installed.
2. Make sure the install location for mongoDB is included in the system path for simplicity in running the app.  Add mongoDB to the path if necessary.
3. Clone the repo to the local machine if not already done.
4. Open two terminal or command prompt windows.
5. Run "mongod" in one of the windows.
6. Navigate to the root of the project in the other window.
7. Run "npm install" to install all of the app's dependencies.
8. Run "node server.js" to start the server.
9. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.  You will see an empty blog with boxes and buttons for creating new posts.  New posts will appear below this area once created.
